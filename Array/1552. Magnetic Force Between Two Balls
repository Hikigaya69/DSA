//In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has n empty baskets, the ith basket is at position[i], Morty has m balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.
//Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions x and y is |x - y|.
//Given the integer array position and the integer m. Return the required force.
//Medium
